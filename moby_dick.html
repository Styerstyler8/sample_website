    <!-- much here to be styled, will do so in last section -->

    <!-- Some new commands are added here:
    <header> is used as a block element that can be formatted later with CSS.
    <div> is used to set page divisions apart, but no effect until stylized with CSS
    <span> is similar to div, but span is an inline element, while div is block
    <blockquote> does exactly what it says
    <ol> will create an ordered list as 1. 2. 3. and will have a new line for each number.
    <li> is used with ol as a list element. This will put the text after the number. 1. (li text here).
    <ul> creates an unordered list, which is a list of bullet points and uses the li tag as well for each bullet point.

        The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform
        was designed mainly for ebooks like the
        <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>
        book</a> and <a href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough
        HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good for making more
        traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman
        Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a
        short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of
        American literature.

         <!-- Below is an example of styling a picture. height or width can be used to set the maximum pixel size for a picture (do not use both at same time). float allows for text to flow around an image (can do left or right, no center). Now to add space next to an image so text isnt smashed up to it, we can use margin (other options like padding and borders also exist). You can specify specific margin values for each direction, in the order: top, right, bottom, left (can also use margin-direction) (Can also use 2 values for margins margin: 20px 40px would put margin 20px for top and bottom and left and right at 40px). Another margin trixk is to use margin: auto which insets a margin with size automatically same on all side, so like margin: 0 auto would have no top/bottom margins, but auto margin for left/right which can be used to center images (this only works on block elements). So to work with images, can use display: block so it acts like a block element-->

          <em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
          by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
      </p>

      <!-- Below is an example of styling. style can change the font style and the font size -->
      <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;">
        <p>
          <!-- Below is another example of styling. Span allows for a span of text to be stylized. font-style normal gets rid of the italics from the blockquote style. font-weight allows bold to occur. Color allows for colorized text based of hex values. Below is for red and can also just do color: red-->
          <span style="font-style: normal; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;
          color: #ff0000;">Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago–never mind how long
          precisely–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
          particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
          little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
          driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
        Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
        jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who—<em>spoiler
        alert!</em>—is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
