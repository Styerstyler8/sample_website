    <!-- Some new commands are added here:
    <header> is used as a block element that can be formatted later with CSS.
    <div> is used to set page divisions apart, but no effect until stylized with CSS
    <span> is similar to div, but span is an inline element, while div is block
    <blockquote> does exactly what it says
    <ol> will create an ordered list as 1. 2. 3. and will have a new line for each number.
    <li> is used with ol as a list element. This will put the text after the number. 1. (li text here).
    <ul> creates an unordered list, which is a list of bullet points and uses the li tag as well for each bullet point.

        The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform
        was designed mainly for ebooks like the
        <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>
        book</a> and <a href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough
        HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good for making more
        traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman
        Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a
        short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of
        American literature.

          <em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
          by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago–never mind how long
          precisely–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
          particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
          little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
          driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
        Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
        jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who—<em>spoiler
        alert!</em>—is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
      </p>
